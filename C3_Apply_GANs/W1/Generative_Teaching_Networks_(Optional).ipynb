        "# Generative Teaching Networks (GTN)\n",
        "\n",
        "*Please note that this is an optional notebook, meant to introduce more advanced concepts if you're up for a challenge, so don't worry if you don't completely follow! The first author of this work, Felipe Such, reviewed this notebook for you.*\n",
        "\n",
        "### Goals \n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you'll be implementing a Generative Teaching Network (GTN), first introduced in [Generative Teaching Networks: Accelerating Neural Architecture Search by Learning to Generate Synthetic Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07768) (Such et al. 2019). Essentially, a GTN is composed of a generator (i.e. teacher), which produces synthetic data, and a student, which is trained on this data for some task. The key difference between GTNs and GANs is that GTN models work cooperatively (as opposed to adversarially).\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this notebook, you'll gain (deeper) exposure to the following concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **End-to-End Data Augmentation.** Data augmentation refers to the generation of more data from existing data to *augment* the training set. Examples of this with images include operations like random cropping and flipping. In this sense, the generator performs data augmentation by synthesizing data as extra training data. GTNs differ from previous data augmentation approaches in that:\n",
        "    - The generator and student are trained together, as opposed to training and freezing the generator, then training the student.\n",
        "    - The real data plays a small role: it's only used once every several student updates to update the generator with respect to the student's performance.\n",
        "    - The generated data doesn't look realistic (see visualization later in notebook) yet it's more effective for training the student than real data is!\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Curriculum Learning.** The generator not only can synthesize data from random noise, but also can learn this random noise, or *curriculum*. By backpropagating through the inputs, the generator can be trained to select the curricula that it deems will be best for student learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Meta-Learning.** Meta-learning refers to \"learning to learn,\" a broad field that optimizes over different learning tasks to find the best way to learn. You're probably an example of a good meta-learner :). A GTN accomplishes this by training the generator to understand how the student learns, demonstrated via curriculum learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Neural Architecture Search.** But wait, there's still more! The generator doesn't just guide student training, it also can help determine the optimal student architecture (i.e. which layers, network depth). This concept of learning the best architecture is called Neural Architecture Search, or NAS. Pretty convenient, huh!\n",
        "\n",
        "![Figure 1a from the paper](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/GANs-Public/blob/master/gtn_fig1.png?raw=true)\n",
        "*Figure 1(a) from the [GTN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.07768.pdf), providing an overview of the method*\n",
        "\n",
        "### Learning Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this notebook, you should:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Understand the concepts of teaching networks, meta-learning, and neural architecture search, and how they relate to the objective of data augmentation.\n",
        "2. Implement and train a GTN on MNIST, and observe how a GTN can accelerate training."

        "Start by running the following two cells. The first cell imports packages that you'll use and checks whether the package, [Higher](https://github.com/facebookresearch/higher) (by Facebook Research), is installed. Higher allows you to \"unroll\" inner gradient updates. Unrolling inner updates means that instead of computing updates in a loop where previous updates are overwritten (i.e. one step of traditional SGD), each update is stored, which makes it easier to compute and apply gradients to the generator through multiple updates of the student.\n"

        "Now you know how GTN-generated data augmentation can be useful for training classifiers quickly which in turn allows us to more efficiently search for best performing model architectures. You've seen how the whole process can be trained end-to-end, instead of training one model first, then another — you can certainly apply this principle elsewhere as you build your systems, merging different steps of the training process as you let the gradient flow all the way through your system! You've touched on evolving areas of research, such as curriculum learning, meta-learning, and neural architecture search (NAS), which you can also take to your other projects."
